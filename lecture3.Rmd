## Today's plan

1. Review of last week
2. More exercises on dplyr and ggplot
3. Saving a graph
4. Plot with several graphs
5. git: create your git repository on github


## Review: ggplot

```{r review_ggplot}
ggplot(data=mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

## Count and distribution

Continuous variable
```{r count1,out.width=500}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x=displ),binwidth = 0.1)
```


## Review: dplyr

1. Pick observations (rows) by their values: `filter()`
2. Reorder the rows: `arrange()`
3. Pick variable (columns) by names: `select()`
4. Create new variables from existing variable: `mutate()`
5. Collapse many values down to a single summary: `summarize()`

## Review: load data from a file

```{r review_load}
myFile="~/repo/dataNeuroCourse/dataSets/tmaze.csv" 
df<-read_csv(myFile)
df<-mutate(df, correct = sample != choice)
```

## Review: summarise

```{r summarize}
summarise(df, performance = mean(correct))
```

## Review: group_by and summarise

Collapse according to some groups.
```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tibble_tmaze_group_by_summarise.png")
```

## Review: group_by and summarise


```{r group_by}
by_df<-group_by(df,mouse)
summarise(by_df,performance= mean(correct))
```


## Review: using the pipe symbole (%>%) 

```{r review_pipe}
blockdf <- df %>% 
  select(mouse,block,correct) %>% 
  group_by(block) %>% 
  summarize(performance=mean(correct))
# print the first few lines
head(blockdf)
```


## Question from last week

```{r set_colors,fig.height=3}
myColors<-c("2seater" = "blue", "compact" = "green",
            "midsize" = "black", "minivan" = "red",
            "pickup" = "grey", "subcompact" = "darkgreen",
            "suv" = "darkblue")
ggplot(data=mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=hwy,y=cty, color = class)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = myColors)
```


## Work with dplyr and ggplot

* Create a data frame in which you have the performance of single mice on single blocks. Use the Pipe! 

* Save the code from these exercises for later.

***

```{r ex0 }
df %>% 
  group_by(mouse,block) %>% 
  summarise(performance = mean(correct))
```

## Work with dplyr and ggplot

* Plot a histogram showing the distribution of performance on every block and mouse (mouse1-block1, mouse1-block2, mouseN-blockN). 

***

```{r ex1, fig.width = 4,fig.height=3 }
new_df<-df %>% 
  group_by(mouse,block) %>% 
  summarise(performance = mean(correct))

ggplot (data=new_df) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = performance),binwidth=0.01)
```

## Work with dplyr and ggplot

* The first 3 days of training (e.g, blocks) had 20 trials instead of 10. Plot the distribution of performance on every block and mouse, but only for blocks with 10 trials.

***

Solution 1

```{r ex2, fig.width = 4,fig.height=3}
new_df <- df %>%
  group_by(mouse, block) %>%
  summarise(nTrials = n(), performance = mean(correct)) %>%
  filter(nTrials == 10) ## filter after summarise

ggplot (data = new_df) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = performance), binwidth = 0.01)
```

*** 

Solution 2

```{r ex2.2, fig.width = 4,fig.height=3}
new_df <- df %>%
  filter(block > 3) %>% ## filter before summarise
  group_by(mouse, block) %>%
  summarise(performance = mean(correct))

ggplot (data = new_df) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = performance), binwidth = 0.01)
```


## Work with dplyr and ggplot

* Make a plot showing the mean performance of mice on each block. Use geom_line or geom_point.

***

```{r ex3,fig.width = 6,fig.height=4}
df %>% group_by(mouse,block) %>% 
  summarise(performance = mean(correct)) %>% # mean per mouse per block
  group_by(block) %>% 
  summarise(global_performance = mean(performance)) %>% # mean per block
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(mapping=aes(x=block,y=global_performance))
```

## Work with dplyr and ggplot

Your supervisor is very picky. They want the following changes made to the last graph.

1. The performance should be in percentages instead of probability.
2. The line should be blue. 
3. The x and y labels should be called "Performance (%)" and "Block", respectively
4. The range of the y axis to go from 40 to 100.
5. A horizontal line should be added at 50 % to indicate chance level.

***

```{r ex5,fig.width = 4,fig.height=3}
df %>% group_by(mouse,block) %>% 
  summarise(performance = mean(correct)*100) %>%
  group_by(block) %>% 
  summarise(global_performance = mean(performance)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(mapping=aes(x=block,y=global_performance),color="blue")+
  ylim(40,100) +
  xlab("Block") +
  ylab("Performance (%)")+
  geom_hline(mapping = aes(yintercept=50),linetype="dashed")

```


## Work with dplyr and ggplot

* Do you think all mice learned equally? It would be great to have a plot for each mouse. Use the facet_wrap function to plot several graphs into the same plot.

***

```{r ex4,fig.width = 4,fig.height=3}
df1 <- df %>% group_by(mouse,block) %>% 
  summarise(performance = mean(correct)*100)
ggplot(data=df1) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance)) +
  geom_line(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance),color = "blue") +
  ylab("Performance (%)") +
  xlab("Block") +
  geom_hline(mapping = aes(yintercept=50),linetype="dashed") +
  facet_wrap(~mouse)
```

## Work with dplyr and ggplot

* It would be great to have a graph that displays this variability in performance without having to show the 7 mice separately. How could we do this?


***

```{r exp5, fig.width = 5,fig.height=2}
#df1 is the data frame we just created 
df1 %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance))+
  geom_smooth(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance)) 
```

Do you see any problems with this plot? 

***

Use some jitter to solve overplotting. This solve the overplotting but is less precise!

```{r exp6, fig.width = 5,fig.height=2}
df1 %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance),position="jitter")+
  geom_smooth(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance)) 
```

Most people will not like this solution. The block separation is gone.


***

```{r exp7, fig.width = 5,fig.height=2}
df1 %>% 
ggplot( aes(x = factor(block), y = performance)) +
  geom_dotplot(binaxis = "y", stackdir = "center") +
  geom_smooth(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance))
  

```

Each point now clearly belongs to a block. This is pretty good.

***

```{r exp8, fig.width = 3,fig.height=2}
df1 <- df %>% group_by(mouse,block) %>% 
  summarise(performance = mean(correct))
df1 %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance,group=block))
```

This is also pretty good.

## Saving a graph

```{r save1, echo=FALSE,out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio-export-figure.png")
```

## Saving a graph

`ggsave()` saves the latest plot that was displayed

```{r save2,  fig.width = 3,fig.height=2,results=FALSE}
df1 %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance,group=block))

myFileName="/home/kevin/Downloads/myPlot.pdf"
ggsave(filename = myFileName,
       device = "pdf", units = "cm", 
       width = 10, height = 10)
```


## Plot with several graphs

* Store graphs as variables

```{r sevGraphs1, fig.width = 3,fig.height=2}
p1<- df1 %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance,group=block),color="blue")+
  ggtitle("Performance per block")
```

```{r sevGraphs2,fig.width = 3,fig.height=2}
p1
```

## Plot with several graphs

Let's store several graphs in variables

```{r, sevGraphs3}
p1 <- df %>%
  group_by(mouse, block) %>%
  summarise(nTrials = n(), performance = mean(correct)) %>%
  filter(nTrials == 10) %>% 
  ggplot () +
    geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = performance), binwidth = 0.01)
```

***

```{r sevGraphs4}
p2 <- df %>% group_by(mouse,block) %>% 
  summarise(performance = mean(correct)*100) %>%
  group_by(block) %>% 
  summarise(global_performance = mean(performance)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(mapping=aes(x=block,y=global_performance),color="blue")+
  ylim(40,100) +
  xlab("Block") +
  ylab("Performance (%)")+
  geom_hline(mapping = aes(yintercept=50),linetype="dashed")
```

***

```{r sevGraphs5}
p3 <-df %>% group_by(mouse,block) %>% 
  summarise(performance = mean(correct)*100) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_point(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance)) +
    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance),color = "blue") +
    ylab("Performance (%)") +
    xlab("Block") +
    geom_hline(mapping = aes(yintercept=50),linetype="dashed") +
    facet_wrap(~mouse)
```

***

```{r sevGraphs6}
p4 <- df %>% group_by(mouse,block) %>% 
  summarise(performance = mean(correct)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(x=block,y=performance,group=block),color="blue") +
  ggtitle("Performance per block") +
  ylab("Performance (%)") +
  xlab("Block")
```

***

Now put these graphs together.

```{r sevGraphs7, fig.width = 6,fig.height=4}
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
```

***

```{r sevGraphs8, fig.width = 6,fig.height=5}
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2)
```

***

Use `pdf()` and `dev.off()` to save your new creation.

```{r sevGraphs9}
myFileName="/home/kevin/Downloads/allMyPlots.pdf"
pdf(file=myFileName,paper = "a4") # open the file
all_ps <- grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2) # write
dev.off() # close the file
```
